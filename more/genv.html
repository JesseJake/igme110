            Pokémon Black and White is the first title to accumulate less sales than its prior installement, while still being a 
            commercial success. In comparison with Diamond and Pearl, the prior generation, Pokémon Black and White hit around 2 million less sales.
            With many fans citing Pokémon Black and White as their favorite generation, it is questionable why this game did worse than its 
            predecessors. With innovations in story, design, gameplay, and more, this installment had interestingly become 
            perhaps both the most forgettable yet most memorable mattering on who you'd ask. This comes down to a difference in 
            previously core features of the Pokémon series, which is a similar reason for the outrage seen in the <a href="genviii.html">
            Gen VIII controversy.</a>

            The criticisms in Pokémon Black and White came down to a lack of nostalgic air, the game having decided to not include previous Pokémon 
            until the post-game. Additionally, Black and White attempted to be so ground-breaking that it introduced a plethora of
            changes, in region, battling, visuals, in depth storytelling, and so forth. The amount of changes had become unwelcome to 
            returning fans who had wished for a similar, nostalgic adventure that did not reach so far in grasping new audiences. This is 
            where its controversy comes in, as while many fans came to appreciate this game as the most innovative, with more focus on 
            storytelling than any of its predecessors or successors, more new Pokémon and a different take on setting, this also became 
            its downfall for those who had become attached to the simularity of those old features.
