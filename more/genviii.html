            Pokémon Sword and Shield is set to release November 15th, 2019. As of writing this, the games have yet 
            to be released. Despite this, what has been relvealed about the games caused quite the storm amongst 
            many long-time fans of the franchise, so much so that an official apology was released by Nintendo. 
            For the first main title Pokémon game to be released on a TV-console rather than a portable (or, has 
            the potential, as that is the schtick of the Nintendo Switch), the reception of the game seems to be 
            heading in a troublesome direction.

            While some of the circumstances surrounding this controversy couldn't be more different from that <a href="genv.html">
            Gen V</a> experienced, one similar aspect also brought on this outrage: change. More specifically, change in the way that 
            previous Pokémon could be obtained. While Gen V made previous generation Pokémon unavailable until the 
            post-game without trade, Pokémon Sword and Shield has announced some prior Pokémon will be unavailable 
            entirely. Even if the game is finished or you try to trade from a prior game, it is impossible to obtain 
            some Pokémon nostalgic to the players. Not only this, but the visuals played an ascept in the outrage as well. 
            Not from change, but a lack of change. Despite the impressive capabilites of the Switch shown to potential in 
            fan favorites like Breath of the Wild, the visuals showcased in Sword and Shield are mediocre in comparison, 
            and resemble the models on the much weaker console of the 3DS.
