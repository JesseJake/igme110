            Pokémon is a beloved franchise for many, having started in 1996 by Satoshi Tajiri with inspiration from his 
            childhood. He "wanted to capture his own experience of exploring the rice fields and rivers of his childhood 
            town to collect insects." (<a href ="more/credits.html">Keough, 2016</a>). From then on, the series captured many's hearts and achieved worldwide recognition. 
            However, the franchise has encountered a fair number of controversies in it's long-standing popularity, from 
            problematic visuals in TV show episodes to abuse of copyrights.
